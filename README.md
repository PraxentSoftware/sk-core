StarterKit Core
===============

This repo contains scripts to automate provisioning, build, and
deployment. The purpose of this repository is to pin the versions
of each submodule. This way, build, deploy, and provision can be
updated independantly. Each release of sk_core will encompass
these updates, without breaking any sites built on older versions.
